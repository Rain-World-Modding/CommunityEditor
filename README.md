## Using
Use the pre-compiled executable included in the Releases tab (see the sidebar on the right). Editing requires opening the .dir file in Adobe Director, which is no longer obtainable through Adobe as it has been discontinued (though this doesn't mean it isn't obtainable at all \*wink wink hint hint nudge nudge\*). **Editing the code/assets directly does not do anything, as they are simply a mirror of the files contained within the project file**.

## Contributing
Direct contributions to asset files in this repository (without modifying the project file to reflect the changes) are not welcome. Changes can be sent to @alduris or @M4rblel1ne for merging.

If you are allowed to update, make sure to export files using the keybind Tab+E+A ***within Adobe Director*** (otherwise the code files won't output), change the line endings on all code files to use line feeds (Adobe Director uses carriage return but GitHub doesn't recognize it as a valid line ending)
